/* Approach: Individual CTEâ€™s are used to make connection clean and understandable

1. Cleaned the US_CITIES to have one row per combination of city and state abbreviation. 
2. Connected Customer personal data with customer address and inner joined to cities CTE; to allow customer whose cities are in the Cities CTE to be permitted
3. Create Supplier location CTE with the help of Cities CTE; to provide latitude and longitude data
4. Cross joining customer location and supplier location to get a matrix of all possible combinations. 
I tried HAVERSINE before checking the instructions ; later I used ST_DISTANCE to compare. There is a slight difference in numbers but it's negligible looking at the overall picture. 
Ranked the distances for each customer and picked the RANK = 1 to get the shortest distance.
